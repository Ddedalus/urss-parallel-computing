# URSS 2018: Parallel computing
Code I've written for my 10 weeks research project in Computer Science.
Among other bits and pieces:
  - analysis of basic statistical properties of a class of graphs obtained from biological applications (R)
  - an implementation of a novel algorithm for computing average shortest paths which has been invented by a research group based in Oxford/Newcastle. (C++)
  - a parallel version of that same algorithm using OpenMP (C++)
  - experiments with a distributed implementation based on Akka (Scala)
